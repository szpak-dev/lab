# Joining (Lesson: Joins)
In order to insert Cars and rentals, you have to run these SQL scripts:

```sql
\i /opt/data/3.1-insert-clients.sql
\i /opt/data/3.2-insert-rentals.sql
```

You can now proceed to having fun with SQL queries. Please, remember that examples used in the tutorial are just a tiny
fraction of what you can do with the data. Don't hesitate to try other ways to fetch or manipulate the data.

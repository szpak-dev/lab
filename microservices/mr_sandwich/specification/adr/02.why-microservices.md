# Title
Why Microservices Used

# Context
Customer asked us to write system using Microservices, because we need some fancy story for this tutorial.

# Decision
We decided to use Microservices and split them by the Bounded Contexts. Services will communicate via REST API.

# Consequences
Loosely coupled services are easier to develop, maintain and deploy, because they operate on a small part of 
functionalities provided by the system. Downside is that they are separately deployable, what makes DevOps work harder,
but still feasible and open for automation.

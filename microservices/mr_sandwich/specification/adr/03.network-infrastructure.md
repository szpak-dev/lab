# Title
How Network Infrastructure Look Like

# Context
Secure and fast network is required to operate efficiently and automate whatever possible.

# Decision
For the sake of security and simplicity, we decided to use private network behind Load Balancer. Every microservice is 
represented as a separate thread, it exposes API via HTTP, which can be accessed from another microservice via private 
network. It is also possible to access microservices straight from the Internet, LB will translate and proxy pass HTTP
requests to corresponding processes behind NAT.

# Consequences
Easy to maintain and administer private network, where containers are not accessible from outside of subnetwork. It just
helps us to care less about security, so we can focus on development of features.

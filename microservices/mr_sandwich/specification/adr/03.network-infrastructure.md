# Title
How Network Infrastructure Look Like

# Context
Secure and fast network is required to operate efficiently and automate whatever possible.

# Decision
For the sake of security and simplicity, we decided to use private network behind Load Balancer.
Every microservice is represented as a separate thread, it exposes API via HTTP, which can be accessed from the 
internet or from another microservice via private network.

# Consequences
Easy to maintain and administer private network, where containers are not accessible from outside of subnetwork. It just
helps us to care less about security, so we can focus on development of features.

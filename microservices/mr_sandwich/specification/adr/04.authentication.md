# Title
Authentication 

# Context
We need a specialized microservice, which will authenticate incoming HTTP requests.

# Decision
Decision was made, to use API gateway pattern. Every request will be passed through Authentication Service, which will 
search for a secured, http-only cookie, which contains `session_id` key. This means we deal with a browser client. To 
make XSS attacks harder, we use secured, http only cookie, which is not accessible with Javascript. If there is an 
`Authentication` header present, it will be overwritten by the Authorization service, which will set its own JWT for the
target microservice.

# Consequences
Every HTTP request will have to pass through the `Authentication` service, which is the guard for the backend system.
Microservices will not be available from the Internet, but they still can communicate within a private network. Every
microservice will have to lookup inside JWT to check the claims, so it can `authorize` incoming request. If request 
comes from the internet, it will have JWT appended by the `Authentication` service. If request comes from another 
microservice, it will contain a hard-coded, infinite JWT generated in `Authentication` service.
